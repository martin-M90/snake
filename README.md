# snake

This is a modified version of the classic Snake game. The game is written in Python using the Turtle graphics library.

## Functionalities Added:
1. **Food Movement**: The food now moves randomly by one step at a time without going out of the window.
2. **Random Colors for Snake and Food**: Each time the game runs, the snake and food have random colors chosen from a set of five, excluding red.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python snake.py
